#IT STARTS HERE!!!!!!!

#ENTRY 1: 10/23/2025, time: 12:32PM

	This is my first log entry. Obviously a little late on starting the project but I do have the whole day to work on this so I will still add commits throughout the day with time stamps on it and hopefuly be able to finish it today instead of stretching it all the way to tomorrow!

What I know about this project: I am going to create a prefix notation calculator that has two modes, an interactive mode(which it is by default) that continously asks the user for expressions, and also a batch mode which is activated using a batch flag, and it won't prompt you or anything just outputs the answer.

another importnat part of this porject i skeeping the history of results wtih newest first in a queue(this just means you don't actually need to reverse, all I would need to do is cons the answer to a history array and save it somehow and just return the history so it should be fairly simple)

I think I should first start off with the interactive section, then batch, then handle errors at the end and the history thign shouldn't be too hard
